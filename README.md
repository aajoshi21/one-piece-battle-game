**CONTEXT:**
One Piece is an anime and manga which has been running for over 25 years. It follows the story of a pirate adventure, and the two
main factions are the pirates and the marines. These two forces are in opposition, but there are also often fights between two pirate 
crews or occasionally within the marine faction. Characters in this series have a variety of abilities, most common being weapons, 
the power of "haki" (based on willpower, can increase a characters powers of observation or defense/strength, among other things), and
"devil fruits" (a magical fruit which gives the person who eats it a power...far to arbitrary and complicated for me to explain fully - 
just take my word for it).
